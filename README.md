Poker Dice 

Rules:

 - Roll 5 Dice
 - You may re-roll any of the Die twice per turn
 - Put a token on any tile that matches a combination shown on the Dice. (ie: If your role has two 1's, and two 6's you can choose either the tile with 1-1-6-6, or the tile with 1-1, or the tile with 6-6)
 - 5 tokens in a row creates a line
 - Create two lines to win the game
 - Middle tile is free and counts as a token for both players 
 - You cannot cross the free square to make a line
